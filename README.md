rotate
======

Rotate text by 90, 180 or 270 degrees, mirror text, transpose text.

The live demo below showcases those three different modes.

If python in version 3 is available, you can also run `rotate` from the
command line as `rotate.py infile outfile degrees`.
`degrees` will round down to multiples of `90`.

Note: `degrees=90` will rotate **counterclockwise** (positive rotation)!
